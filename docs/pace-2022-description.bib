abstract = {This standard textbook of modern graph theory, now in its fifth edition, combines the authority of a classic with the engaging freshness of style that is the hallmark of active mathematics. It covers the core material of the subject with concise yet reliably complete proofs, while offering glimpses of more advanced methods in each field by one or two deeper results, again with proofs given in full detail. The book can be used as a reliable text for an introductory course, as a graduate text, and for self-study. From the reviews: This outstanding book cannot be substituted with any other book on the present textbook market. It has every chance of becoming the standard textbook for graph theory. Acta Scientiarum Mathematiciarum Deep, clear, wonderful. This is a serious book about the heart of graph theory. It has depth and integrity. Persi Diaconis &amp; Ron Graham, SIAM Review The book has received a very enthusiastic reception, which it amply deserves. A masterly elucidation of modern graph theory. Bulletin of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications Succeeds dramatically ... a hell of a good book. MAA Reviews A highlight of the book is what is by far the best account in print of the Seymour-Robertson theory of graph minors. Mathematika ... like listening to someone explain mathematics.

	title = {On computing the minimum feedback vertex set of a directed graph by contraction operations},
	volume = {19},
	issn = {02780070},
	abstract = {Finding the minimum feedback vertex set (MFVS) in a graph is an important problem for a variety of computer-aided design (CAD) applications and graph reduction plays an important role in solving this intractable problem. This paper is largely concerned with three new and powerful reduction operations. Each of these operations defines a new class of graphs, strictly larger than the class of contractible graphs [Levy and Low (1988)], in which the MFVS can be found in polynomial-time complexity. Based on these operations, an exact algorithm run on branch and bound manner is developed. This exact algorithm uses a good heuristic to find out an initial solution and a good bounding strategy to prune the solution space. To demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms, we have implemented our algorithms and applied them to solving the partial scan problem in ISCAS’89 benchmarks. The experimental results show that if our three new contraction operations are applied, 27 out of 31 circuits in ISCAS’89 benchmarks can be fully reduced. Otherwise, only 12 out of 31 can be fully reduced. Furthermore, for all ISCAS’89 benchmarks our exact algorithm can find the exact cutsets in less than 3 s (CPU time) on SUN-UltraII workstation. Therefore, the new contraction operations and our algorithms are demonstrated to be very effective in the partial scan application.},

	title = {A {Contraction} {Algorithm} for {Finding} {Small} {Cycle} {Cutsets}.},
	volume = {9},
	abstract = {We consider the problem of finding a minimum size cutset in a directed graph G = (V, E), i.e., a vertex set that cuts all cycles in G. Since the general problem is NP-complete we concentrate on finding small cutsets. The algorithm we suggest uses contraction operations to reduce the graph size and to identify candidates for the cutset; the complexity of the algorithm is O({\textbar}E{\textbar}log{\textbar}V{\textbar}). This contraction algorithm is compared to Shamir-Rosen algorithm. It is shown that the class of graphs for which the contraction algorithm finds a minimum cutset (completely contractible graphs) properly contains the class of graphs for which Shamir-Rosen algorithm finds a minimum cutset (quasi-reducible graphs) and thus that the contraction algorithm is more powerful. As a by-product of this analysis we construct a hierarchy of the classes of graphs for which minimum cutsets can be found efficiently. The class of quasi-reducible graphs lies, in this hierarchy, between two classes which are closely related. This result illuminates the nature of the quasi-reducible graphs. The hierarchy constructed allows us also to compare the Wang-Lloyd-Soffa algorithm to the Shamir-Rosen algorithm and to the contraction algorithm.},
